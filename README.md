## Planning and Development

Planning:
1. Start coding
2. Complete small goals that lead upto a big goal
3. Make adjustments along the way
4. Acquire crucial feedback for improvement
5. Implement feedback goals
6. Refactor

#### My Process

1. Start coding
2. Build Resource - games
3. Add games relationship to user
4. Make Create, Read controller actions for games back end
5. Make some custom routes and serializers
6. Start working on front end
7. Create logic for one of the problems
8. Create game display
9. Create three more logic problems
10. Implment all four problems
11. Create Create, Read for games front end
12. Build MVP resource - suggestions
13. Add suggestions relationship to user
14. Make CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) actions for suggestions back end
15. Make CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) actions for suggestions front end
16. Style with HTML and Bootstrap
17. Get feedback, implment changes

#### Initial wireframes and user stories

7. As a user, I want to go to all previous games.
8. As a user, I want to go make a public suggestion.
9. As a user, I want to go CRUD a public suggestion.

## Problem Solving Strategy

1. Break down problems into smallest solvable problem and build up.
2. Take a break after certain amount of time regardless of progress.
3. Write down diagrams if stuck.
4. Explain code to peers for different approaches to solve the problem.

## Unsolved Problems (Problem Working on at the time of editing this file)


## Future Direction (Super Stretch Goals)


1. 3 2 1 Countdown before game starts
2. query score by player
3. my scores graph
4. compare my score to queried player
